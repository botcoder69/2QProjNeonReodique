				<h2 id="introduction" style="font-size: 24px;">Introduction</h2>
				<p>
					A webpage explaining some of the most popular "Generation Z Memes" to other people who don't get them so they can relate. This webpage contains everything there is to know about the most known Gen Z memes, so that other generations who don't get them can relate, especially when watching on: 
					<ul>
						<li>Youtube</li>
						<li>YouTube Shorts</li>
						<li>TikTok</li>
					</ul>
					There are people in older/younger generations that don't get Gen Z memes, probably because they don't bother, or they're just too busy, and the fact that there are a LOT of existing Gen Z memes that they probably don't know where to start.

				<h2 id="rock-eyebrow-raise" style="font-size: 24px">The Rock's Eyebrow Raise</h2>
				<p>
					The Rock's Eyebrow Raise refers to a reaction video of actor and former professional wrestler Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson raising his eyebrow accompanied by the Vine Thud sound effect. The memes first gained popularity in March 2021, achieving a major surge in September 2021 as memers paired the reactions with Among Us memes, which were used to convey suspicion. <br>
					<br>
					On October 9th, 2019, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson posted an Instagram video addressed to rapper DaBaby, and at the end of said video, he did the iconic expression. 

					<video controls width="640" height="360" class="center-picture" src="../mmfiles/rock_eyebrow_raise_origin.mp4"></video>

					Roughly 2 years later, on February 19th, 2021, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson posted a TikTok video set to "Ice Ice Baby" by Vanilla ice in which he does the iconic expression. 

					<video controls width="640" height="360" class="center-picture" src="../mmfiles/rock_eyebrow_raise_tiktok.mp4"></video>

					Due to the meme gaining virality during 2020, which was the time of Among Us memes, the meme was sometimes used in conjunction with the Among Us memes to signify something "sus", which is just a shortened term of "suspicious" <br>
					<br>
					This meme is a bit special, since it's used in both a video format if you're scrolling through YouTube shorts or TikTok and a GIF format in messaging apps.

					This part of the webpage will list memes that are common in the areas listed in the <a class="a-link" href="#introduction">introduction</a>, some memes we will talk about are:
					
					<table class="picture-organizer">
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<th><img src="../images/rickroll.png" class="picture-border"/></th>
								<th>The <strong>Rickroll</strong>. One of the famous memes you can find on the internet, it's usually done with baiting people into Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up" by saying the video is part of the current online topic.</th>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<th><img src="../images/gigachad.png" class="picture-border"/></th>
								<th>The <strong>Gigachad</strong>. Another famous meme you can find on the internet, most likely YouTube Shorts. It's usually how "acceptable" you are in their opinion.</th>
							</tr>
							<tr>
								<th><img src="../images/amogus.png" class="picture-border"/></th>
								<th>The <strong>Amogus</strong>. A decently famous meme you can find on the internet, most likely YouTube Shorts and TikTok. It's usually means that you're sus (suspicious), for example, when you say something inappropriate or somewhat suspicious. I'll use my ValEd class as an example. Ma'am had a slide saying "Which do you prefer, Black or White?" For us, this is "sus" because it feels like racism, and is trying to trick us. Another form of "sus" things would be "anime wallpapers." For this case, I'll use the Roblox Bedwars YouTuber I watch known as "<a class="a-link" href="https://youtube.com/c/TanqR">TanqR</a>"</th>
