				<h2 id="introduction" style="font-size: 24px;">Introduction</h2>
				<p>
					A webpage explaining some of the most popular "Generation Z Memes" to other people who don't get them so they can relate. This webpage contains everything there is to know about the most known Gen Z memes, so that other generations who don't get them can relate, especially when watching on: 
					<ul>
						<li>Youtube</li>
						<li>YouTube Shorts</li>
						<li>TikTok</li>
					</ul>
					There are people in older/younger generations that don't get Gen Z memes, probably because they don't bother, or they're just too busy, and the fact that there are a LOT of existing Gen Z memes that they probably don't know where to start.
				</p>
				
				
				
				<h2 id="what-are-memes-anyways" style="font-size: 24px">What are memes, anyways?</h2>
				<p>
					Usually, a meme is either a video/picture that carries a symbolic meaning. Pictures, more specifically "meme templates" are usually overlaid with text, an meme using a widely known meme template is shown below.

					<img class="center-picture" src="images/spongebob_throwing_paper_in_fire.jpeg">

					If you can't interpret what's up there, since Spongebob, representing "Pisay Scholars", threw the paper, representing "Requirement Deadlines", into the fire, this meme tries to convey that Pisay Scholars don't care about deadlines. (I mean, some scholars do care, but pretty much, almost everyone procrastinates until the deadline.) <br> <br>

					Almost anything can become meme material these days, like <strong>Jacob</strong>

					<img class="center-picture" src="images/jacob_becomes_a_meme.jpeg">

					This picture was taken by Sielby, who sent it to Jacob, who then sent it to our group chat, then Gabbi decided to make a meme out of it. This means that memes aren't specific to one genre, and a meme can come from any source, regardless how far it is from "memes".
